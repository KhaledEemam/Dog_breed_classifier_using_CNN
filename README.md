# Udacity-dog-breed-classifier

# Description

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning in order to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used to analyse image data. Transfer learning is a technique that allows to reuse a model across different tasks. The objective is that given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. If the algorithm can't identify the image as a human or dog, it will say so.
